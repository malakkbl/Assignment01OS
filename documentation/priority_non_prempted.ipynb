    "# Comprehensive Analysis of Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements a non-preemptive priority CPU scheduling algorithm where processes with lower priority values receive higher scheduling priority. Unlike the preemptive version, once a process starts executing, it runs to completion without interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Class (Assumed Implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses a `Process` class with these inferred attributes:\n",
    "- `pid`: Process identifier (string/number)\n",
    "- `arrival_time`: When the process enters the system\n",
    "- `burst_time`: Total CPU time needed\n",
    "- `priority`: Priority value (lower number = higher priority)\n",
    "- `turnaround_time`: Time from arrival to completion (calculated during scheduling)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def priority_schedule(process_list: List[Process]):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: List of Process objects\n",
    "- **Output**: List of execution records (dictionaries)\n",
    "- **Helper functions**: Several functions are referenced but not defined in the snippet:\n",
    "  - `sort_by_arrival()`\n",
    "  - `init_current_time()`\n",
    "  - `fast_forward()`\n",
    "  - `run_to_completion()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `arrival` Variable\n",
    "- **Type**: List of Process objects (sorted)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Intermediary storage of processes in arrival order\n",
    "- **Operations**: Created once via `sort_by_arrival(process_list)`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Organizes processes chronologically (only used temporarily)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `ready` Dictionary\n",
    "- **Type**: Dictionary mapping priority values to lists of processes\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Multiple priority buckets in one structure\n",
    "- **Key**: Priority value (lower = higher priority)\n",
    "- **Value**: List of processes at that priority level (FIFO order)\n",
    "- **Operations**:\n",
    "  - `ready[priority].append(p)` to add process\n",
    "  - `ready[priority].pop(0)` to get next process\n",
    "  - `min(available)` to find highest available priority\n",
    "- **Complexity**: O(1) for access/insert, O(k) for finding min (where k = number of priority levels)\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Efficiently groups processes by priority while maintaining arrival order within each group\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `available` List\n",
    "- **Type**: List of priority values\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Identifies which priority levels have processes ready to run\n",
    "- **Operations**: Created each iteration via list comprehension\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Filters priority levels to only those with processes that have arrived by current time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `schedule` List\n",
    "- **Type**: List of dictionaries\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Records execution history\n",
    "- **Structure**: Each dict contains:\n",
    "  - `pid`: Process ID\n",
    "  - `start`: Execution start time\n",
    "  - `finish`: Execution end time\n",
    "  - `turnaround`: Turnaround time\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Complete record of all process executions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `current_time`\n",
    "- **Type**: Numeric (int/float)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The simulation clock\n",
    "- **Initial value**: Set via `init_current_time(arrival)`\n",
    "- **Updates**: Advanced in two situations:\n",
    "  - When jumping to next arrival during idle periods\n",
    "  - When a process completes execution\n",
    "- **Significance**: Represents the current point in simulation time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `next_arrivals`\n",
    "- **Type**: List of timestamps\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Collects the arrival times of the first process in each priority queue\n",
    "- **Used for**: Fast-forwarding time when CPU would otherwise be idle\n",
    "- **Lifecycle**: Created and consumed within one iteration when no processes are ready\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `prio_to_run`\n",
    "- **Type**: Same as priority value (likely int)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Identifies which priority level's process will run next\n",
    "- **Calculation**: Minimum value from the `available` priorities list\n",
    "- **Used for**: Selecting the highest priority process ready to run\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization Phase\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arrival = sort_by_arrival(process_list)\n",
    "ready = {}\n",
    "for proc in arrival:\n",
    "    if proc.priority in ready:\n",
    "        ready[proc.priority].append(proc)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        ready[proc.priority] = [proc]\n",
    "schedule = []\n",
    "current_time = init_current_time(arrival)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process sorting** happens once up front\n",
    "- **Processes are pre-bucketed** by priority before simulation begins\n",
    "- **Time initialization** likely sets to earliest arrival time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while ready:\n",
    "    # Loop body...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Termination condition**: No more processes in any priority bucket\n",
    "- **Event-driven**: Clock advances to events, not by fixed increments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Available Processes\n",
    "```python\n",
    "available = [\n",
    "    prio for prio, lst in ready.items()\n",
    "    if lst and lst[0].arrival_time <= current_time\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List comprehension** efficiently filters priority levels\n",
    "- **Two conditions** checked:\n",
    "  - List for that priority isn't empty\n",
    "  - First process in that list has arrived by current time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idle Handling\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not available:\n",
    "    next_arrivals = [lst[0].arrival_time for lst in ready.values() if lst]\n",
    "    current_time = fast_forward(current_time, next_arrivals)\n",
    "    continue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No available processes** means CPU will be idle\n",
    "- **Collect arrival times** of next process in each non-empty priority bucket\n",
    "- **Fast-forward** clock to the earliest arrival time\n",
    "- **continue** skips to next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Selection and Execution\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prio_to_run = min(available)\n",
    "proc = ready[prio_to_run].pop(0)\n",
    "if not ready[prio_to_run]:\n",
    "    del ready[prio_to_run]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min() function** finds lowest numeric (highest scheduling) priority\n",
    "- **pop(0)** selects first process in that priority list (FIFO)\n",
    "- **Dictionary cleanup** removes empty priority buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Execution and Recording\n",
    "```python\n",
    "start, finish = run_to_completion(proc, current_time)\n",
    "schedule.append({\n",
    "    'pid':        proc.pid,\n",
    "    'start':      start,\n",
    "    'finish':     finish,\n",
    "    'turnaround': proc.turnaround_time\n",
    "})\n",
    "current_time = finish\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **run_to_completion()** simulates non-preemptive execution (likely updates proc.turnaround_time)\n",
    "- **Schedule entry** records full execution details\n",
    "- **Clock advancement** moves to process completion time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pre-Bucketing vs. On-Demand Bucketing\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Pre-bucket all processes by priority at initialization\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Bucket processes as they arrive\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Simpler main loop logic\n",
    "- **Tradeoff**: Uses more memory upfront\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. List of Available Priorities vs. Scanning All Priorities\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Create a filtered list of available priorities each iteration\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Scan all priorities each time\n",
    "- **Advantage**: More efficient selection of next process\n",
    "- **Tradeoff**: Extra list creation each iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Process Deletion vs. Flagging\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Remove processes from ready dictionary when executed\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Flag processes as completed\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Clean data structure, efficient termination check\n",
    "- **Impact**: Simplifies logic by making the loop condition `while ready`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Helper Functions vs. Inline Code\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Extract functionality into helper functions\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Implement all logic inline\n",
    "- **Advantage**: More readable main algorithm, focused on scheduling logic\n",
    "- **Impact**: Code is modular and potentially reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases Handled\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Empty Priority Buckets\n",
    "- **Handling**: Deletes empty priority buckets from ready dictionary\n",
    "- **Line**: `if not ready[prio_to_run]: del ready[prio_to_run]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. No Ready Processes\n",
    "- **Handling**: Fast-forwards time to next arrival\n",
    "- **Line**: `current_time = fast_forward(current_time, next_arrivals)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Zero-Length Jobs\n",
    "- **Handling**: Explicitly mentioned in comments, likely handled in run_to_completion()\n",
    "- **Line**: `# - a zero-length burst job` (in example code)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Idle Gaps Between Processes\n",
    "- **Handling**: Fast-forwards over idle periods\n",
    "- **Line**: `# - an idle gap before the last process arrives` (in example code)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for bucketing = O(n log n)\n",
    "- **Main loop**: O(n) iterations (one per process)\n",
    "- **Finding available priorities**: O(k) where k is number of unique priority values\n",
    "- **Overall complexity**: O(n log n + n*k) ≈ O(n log n) if k is small\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **arrival**: O(n) - temporarily stores all processes\n",
    "- **ready**: O(n) - stores all processes by priority\n",
    "- **schedule**: O(n) - one entry per process\n",
    "- **Overall**: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences from Preemptive Version\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Preemption Check**: Once a process starts, it runs to completion\n",
    "2. **Pre-Bucketing**: Processes are organized by priority at initialization\n",
    "3. **Availability Filter**: Uses list comprehension to filter ready processes\n",
    "4. **Helper Functions**: Abstracts implementation details into separate functions\n",
    "5. **Loop Condition**: Terminates when ready is empty (vs. checking three conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example processes:\n",
    "- A: arrival=2, burst=5, priority=1\n",
    "- B: arrival=0, burst=3, priority=2\n",
    "- C: arrival=4, burst=0, priority=5\n",
    "- D: arrival=10, burst=2, priority=2\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduling sequence would be:\n",
    "1. Time 0: Process B starts (only process arrived)\n",
    "2. Time 3: Process B completes, Process A starts (higher priority than C)\n",
    "3. Time 8: Process A completes, Process C starts\n",
    "4. Time 8: Process C completes immediately (zero burst time)\n",
    "5. Time 10: Process D arrives and starts\n",
    "6. Time 12: Process D completes\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting schedule would show:\n",
    "- B → 0-3 (TAT=3)\n",
    "- A → 3-8 (TAT=6)\n",
    "- C → 8-8 (TAT=4)\n",
    "- D → 10-12 (TAT=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Priority Aging**: Add mechanism to prevent starvation of low-priority processes\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Priority**: Allow priority changes during waiting time\n",
    "3. **More Statistics**: Calculate and return additional metrics (waiting time, response time)\n",
    "4. **Visualization**: Add Gantt chart generation functionality\n",
    "5. **Variable Time Quantum**: Support for time slicing within non-preemptive execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a clean, efficient solution for non-preemptive priority scheduling with a focus on readability and modularity."
