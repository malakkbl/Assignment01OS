    "# Priority Non-Preemptive CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Non-Preemptive is a CPU scheduling algorithm where processes are selected based on their priority value, with lower numeric values indicating higher scheduling priority. Once a process starts executing, it runs to completion without interruption, maintaining the non-preemptive nature of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles\n",
    "- Processes are selected based on priority (lower value = higher priority)\n",
    "- Non-preemptive: once a process starts executing, it runs to completion\n",
    "- Processes with equal priority are handled in FIFO order\n",
    "- When CPU is idle, highest priority ready process is selected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Type**: Non-preemptive\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria**: Priority Value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Attributes\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `pid` | Process identifier |\n",
    "| `arrival_time` | Time when process enters the system |\n",
    "| `burst_time` | CPU time required by the process |\n",
    "| `priority` | Priority value (lower = higher priority) |\n",
    "| `completion_time` | Time when process finishes execution |\n",
    "| `turnaround_time` | Total time from arrival to completion |\n",
    "| `waiting_time` | Time spent waiting in ready queue |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**\n",
    "   - Sort all processes by arrival time\n",
    "   - Initialize ready queues for each priority level\n",
    "   - Set system clock to earliest arrival time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Queue Management**\n",
    "   - Move newly arrived processes to appropriate priority queue\n",
    "   - Maintain FIFO order within each priority level\n",
    "   - Track idle time when no processes are ready\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scheduling Loop**\n",
    "   - Select highest priority (lowest value) ready process\n",
    "   - Execute process to completion (non-preemptive)\n",
    "   - Update system clock and process metrics\n",
    "   - Handle idle periods between processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tracks several key performance indicators:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time spent in ready queue\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time in system (completion - arrival)\n",
    "- **Response Time**: Time until first CPU burst\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of time CPU is busy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "1. **Completed Processes**: List of Process objects with final statistics\n",
    "2. **Schedule**: List of execution records containing:\n",
    "   - Process ID\n",
    "   - Start time\n",
    "   - Finish time\n",
    "3. **Metrics**: Dictionary containing:\n",
    "   - Average waiting time\n",
    "   - Average turnaround time\n",
    "   - Average response time\n",
    "   - CPU utilization\n",
