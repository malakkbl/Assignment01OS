    "# Comprehensive Analysis of the Priority Preemptive CPU Scheduling Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code implements a preemptive priority CPU scheduling algorithm. This document breaks down every aspect of the implementation, from data structures to algorithms and design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Class (Assumed Implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses a `Process` class that's imported but not shown. Based on usage, we can infer it has these attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pid`: Process identifier (string/number)\n",
    "- `arrival_time`: When the process enters the system\n",
    "- `burst_time`/`remaining_time`: Total CPU time needed/remaining\n",
    "- `priority`: Priority value (lower number = higher priority)\n",
    "- `turnaround_time`: Time from arrival to completion (calculated by the scheduler)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def priority_preemptive_schedule(process_list):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: List of Process objects\n",
    "- **Output**: List of execution segments (dictionaries)\n",
    "- **Side effect**: Updates turnaround_time on each Process object when it completes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `arrival` List\n",
    "- **Type**: Sorted list of Process objects\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Queue of processes ordered by arrival time\n",
    "- **Operations**: \n",
    "  - `pop(0)` to get the next arriving process\n",
    "  - Access `arrival[0]` to peek at next arrival\n",
    "- **Complexity**: O(n log n) for initial sort, O(1) for each pop operation\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Efficient retrieval of processes in arrival order\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `ready` Dictionary\n",
    "- **Type**: Dictionary mapping priority values to lists of processes\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Multiple priority queues in one structure\n",
    "- **Key**: Priority value (lower value = higher priority)\n",
    "- **Value**: List of processes at that priority level (FIFO order)\n",
    "- **Operations**:\n",
    "  - `ready[priority].append(p)` to add process\n",
    "  - `ready[priority].pop(0)` to get next process\n",
    "  - `min(ready.keys())` to find highest priority\n",
    "- **Complexity**: O(1) for access/insert, O(k) for finding min (where k = number of priority levels)\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Implements multiple priority queues efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `schedule` List\n",
    "- **Type**: List of dictionaries\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Records execution history\n",
    "- **Structure**: Each dict contains:\n",
    "  - `pid`: Process ID\n",
    "  - `start`: Segment start time\n",
    "  - `finish`: Segment end time\n",
    "  - `turnaround`: Turnaround time (None for preempted segments)\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Complete record of all execution segments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `current_time`\n",
    "- **Type**: Numeric (int/float)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The simulation clock\n",
    "- **Initial value**: First arrival time or 0\n",
    "- **Updates**: Jumps to next significant event (arrival or completion)\n",
    "- **Significance**: Represents the current point in simulation time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `current`\n",
    "- **Type**: Process object or None\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Reference to the currently running process\n",
    "- **Value**: None when CPU is idle\n",
    "- **Used for**: \n",
    "  - Determining if CPU is busy\n",
    "  - Checking if preemption is needed\n",
    "  - Tracking process completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `last_start`\n",
    "- **Type**: Numeric (int/float)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Records when the current execution segment began\n",
    "- **Used for**:\n",
    "  - Calculating segment duration\n",
    "  - Recording segment start times in schedule\n",
    "  - Tracking partial execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization Phase\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arrival = sorted(process_list, key=lambda p: p.arrival_time)\n",
    "ready = {}\n",
    "schedule = []\n",
    "current_time = arrival[0].arrival_time if arrival else 0\n",
    "current = None\n",
    "last_start = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorting** occurs once at initialization, not during the simulation\n",
    "- **Time** starts at the earliest arrival for efficiency\n",
    "- **Empty structures** are initialized for ready queue and schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while arrival or ready or current:\n",
    "    # Loop body...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Termination condition**: No more processes to arrive, no waiting processes, no running process\n",
    "- **Loop invariant**: At the start of each iteration, `current_time` is at a significant event\n",
    "- **Event-driven**: Clock advances to events, not by fixed increments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrival Processing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while arrival and arrival[0].arrival_time <= current_time:\n",
    "    p = arrival.pop(0)\n",
    "    if p.priority in ready:\n",
    "        ready[p.priority].append(p)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        ready[p.priority] = [p]\n",
    "\n",
    "    if current and p.priority < current.priority:\n",
    "        schedule.append({\n",
    "            'pid':       current.pid,\n",
    "            'start':     last_start,\n",
    "            'finish':    current_time,\n",
    "            'turnaround': None\n",
    "        })\n",
    "        ready.setdefault(current.priority, []).insert(0, current)\n",
    "        current = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inner loop** processes all arrivals at the current time\n",
    "- **Dictionary initialization** creates priority queue as needed\n",
    "- **Preemption check** occurs for each arrival\n",
    "- **setdefault** ensures the dictionary key exists before inserting\n",
    "- **insert(0, current)** puts preempted process at front of its queue (not back)\n",
    "- **turnaround: None** marks segment as preempted rather than completed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dispatching\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not current and ready:\n",
    "    prio = min(ready.keys())\n",
    "    current = ready[prio].pop(0)\n",
    "    if not ready[prio]:\n",
    "        del ready[prio]\n",
    "    last_start = current_time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min(ready.keys())** finds highest priority queue (lowest value)\n",
    "- **pop(0)** implements FIFO within priority level\n",
    "- **Dictionary cleanup** removes empty priority queues\n",
    "- **last_start** records the beginning of new segment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idle Handling\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not current:\n",
    "    if arrival:\n",
    "        current_time = arrival[0].arrival_time\n",
    "    continue\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idle CPU** advances time to next arrival\n",
    "- **continue** skips to next iteration\n",
    "- **No ready processes** means CPU will be idle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Scheduling\n",
    "```python\n",
    "next_arrival = arrival[0].arrival_time if arrival else float('inf')\n",
    "finish_time = current_time + current.remaining_time\n",
    "\n",
    "if next_arrival < finish_time:\n",
    "    run_dur = next_arrival - current_time\n",
    "    current.remaining_time -= run_dur\n",
    "    current_time = next_arrival\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    current_time = finish_time\n",
    "    turnaround = current_time - current.arrival_time\n",
    "    schedule.append({\n",
    "        'pid':        current.pid,\n",
    "        'start':      last_start,\n",
    "        'finish':     current_time,\n",
    "        'turnaround': turnaround\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    current.turnaround_time = turnaround\n",
    "    current = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event comparison** determines next significant event\n",
    "- **float('inf')** represents no more arrivals\n",
    "- **Partial execution** updates remaining_time but keeps process as current\n",
    "- **Process completion** records turnaround time and segment\n",
    "- **Turnaround calculation**: completion time - arrival time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Event-Driven vs. Time-Slicing\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Event-driven (jumps to next significant event)\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Time-slicing (increment by fixed time units)\n",
    "- **Advantage**: More efficient, especially with sparse events\n",
    "- **Impact**: Simpler code, faster execution for large timescales\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dictionary of Lists vs. Priority Queue\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Dictionary mapping priorities to lists\n",
    "- **Alternative**: HeapQ or other priority queue implementation\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Natural implementation of multiple priority levels with FIFO within each\n",
    "- **Tradeoff**: Finding min priority is O(k) instead of O(log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Process Object Update vs. Pure Function\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Updates Process.turnaround_time as side effect\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Return both schedule and process stats\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Maintains process state in original objects\n",
    "- **Impact**: Function has side effects (not pure)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Segment-Based Scheduling History\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Records individual execution segments\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Only record process completion times\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Complete execution history with preemption details\n",
    "- **Impact**: More detailed for analysis and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. FIFO Within Priority Levels\n",
    "- **Chosen**: First-come-first-served within same priority\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Round-robin or other algorithm within priority\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Simple and fair for same-priority processes\n",
    "- **Impact**: No starvation within priority level\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Preemption at Front of Queue\n",
    "- **Chosen**: Preempted processes go to front of their priority queue\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Back of queue or special handling\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Minimizes additional waiting after preemption\n",
    "- **Impact**: Maintains fairness for preempted processes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases Handled\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Empty Process List\n",
    "- **Handling**: Sets current_time to 0, returns empty schedule\n",
    "- **Line**: `current_time = arrival[0].arrival_time if arrival else 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multiple Arrivals at Same Time\n",
    "- **Handling**: Inner loop processes all simultaneously arriving processes\n",
    "- **Line**: `while arrival and arrival[0].arrival_time <= current_time`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Equal Priorities\n",
    "- **Handling**: FIFO order within same priority\n",
    "- **Line**: `current = ready[prio].pop(0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. No More Arrivals\n",
    "- **Handling**: Uses float('inf') for next_arrival comparison\n",
    "- **Line**: `next_arrival = arrival[0].arrival_time if arrival else float('inf')`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Idle CPU with No Arrivals\n",
    "- **Handling**: While loop terminates when arrival, ready, and current are all empty/None\n",
    "- **Line**: `while arrival or ready or current`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: O(n log n) due to sorting processes by arrival time\n",
    "- **Main loop**: O(n) iterations, where n is the number of processes\n",
    "- **Finding min priority**: O(k) where k is number of unique priority values\n",
    "- **Overall complexity**: O(n log n + n*k) ≈ O(n log n) if k is small\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **arrival**: O(n) - stores all processes initially\n",
    "- **ready**: O(n) - worst case all processes in ready queue\n",
    "- **schedule**: O(2n-1) ≈ O(n) - worst case, each process except one gets preempted once\n",
    "- **Overall**: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example processes:\n",
    "- A: arrival=0, burst=8, priority=2\n",
    "- B: arrival=1, burst=4, priority=1\n",
    "- C: arrival=12, burst=9, priority=3\n",
    "- D: arrival=14, burst=5, priority=2\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduling sequence is:\n",
    "1. Time 0: Process A starts\n",
    "2. Time 1: Process B arrives, preempts A due to higher priority\n",
    "3. Time 5: Process B completes, A resumes\n",
    "4. Time 12: Process A completes, C starts\n",
    "5. Time 14: Process D arrives, preempts C due to higher priority\n",
    "6. Time 19: Process D completes, C resumes\n",
    "7. Time 26: Process C completes\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting schedule shows:\n",
    "- A → 0 to 1 (preempted)\n",
    "- B → 1 to 5 (completed, TAT=4)\n",
    "- A → 5 to 12 (completed, TAT=12)\n",
    "- C → 12 to 14 (preempted)\n",
    "- D → 14 to 19 (completed, TAT=5)\n",
    "- C → 19 to 26 (completed, TAT=14)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handle Priority Aging**: Prevent starvation of low-priority processes\n",
    "2. **Configurable Tie-Breaking**: Allow different policies within same priority\n",
    "3. **Time Quantum**: Add time slice support for round-robin within priority\n",
    "4. **Process Statistics**: Calculate and return more metrics (waiting time, response time)\n",
    "5. **Visualization**: Add Gantt chart generation functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a clean, efficient solution for preemptive priority scheduling with a focus on correctness and clarity."

    "## 4. Algorithm Components Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Arrival Processing Logic\n",
    "- For each process that has arrived by current_time:\n",
    "  - Remove from arrival list\n",
