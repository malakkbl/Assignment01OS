    "# Priority Round Robin CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Round Robin (PRR) is a hybrid CPU scheduling algorithm that combines priority scheduling with round-robin time sharing. Processes are grouped by priority levels, and within each priority level, processes share the CPU using round-robin scheduling with a fixed time quantum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles\n",
    "- Processes are primarily organized by priority (lower value = higher priority)\n",
    "- Within each priority level, round-robin scheduling is applied\n",
    "- Preemptive: higher priority processes can interrupt lower priority ones\n",
    "- Time quantum limits how long a process can run before being re-queued\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Type**: Preemptive\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria**: Priority \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Attributes\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `pid` | Process identifier |\n",
    "| `arrival_time` | Time when process enters the system |\n",
    "| `burst_time` | Total CPU time required |\n",
    "| `priority` | Priority value (lower = higher priority) |\n",
    "| `remaining_time` | Time left to complete execution |\n",
    "| `completion_time` | Time when process finishes |\n",
    "| `turnaround_time` | Total time from arrival to completion |\n",
    "| `waiting_time` | Time spent waiting in ready queue |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Organization**\n",
    "   - Sort processes by arrival time\n",
    "   - Maintain priority-based ready queues\n",
    "   - Track remaining time for each process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scheduling Loop**\n",
    "   - Check for new arrivals\n",
    "   - Select highest priority ready queue\n",
    "   - Execute process for quantum duration\n",
    "   - Handle preemption and context switches\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Priority Handling**\n",
    "   - Higher priority processes preempt lower priority ones\n",
    "   - Equal priority processes share CPU time slices\n",
    "   - Track idle periods between executions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tracks several key performance indicators:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time spent in ready queue\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time in system (completion - arrival)\n",
    "- **Response Time**: Time until first CPU burst\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of time CPU is busy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completed Processes**: List of Process objects with final metrics:\n",
    "   - Completion time\n",
    "   - Turnaround time\n",
    "   - Waiting time\n",
    "   - Response time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schedule**: List of execution records containing:\n",
    "   - Process ID\n",
    "   - Start time\n",
    "   - Finish time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistics**: Dictionary containing:\n",
    "   - Average waiting time\n",
    "   - Average turnaround time\n",
    "   - Average response time\n",
    "   - CPU utilization\n"
