    "# Round Robin CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Round Robin (RR) is a CPU scheduling algorithm designed for time-sharing systems. It uses time slices (quantum) to ensure fair CPU distribution among all processes. Each process gets a maximum fixed time unit before being preempted and moved to the back of the ready queue if not completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles\n",
    "- Processes get CPU time in a circular order\n",
    "- Fixed time quantum for each execution\n",
    "- Preemptive: process is moved to queue end after quantum expires\n",
    "- Fair CPU distribution among all processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Type**: Preemptive\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria**: FIFO with time slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Attributes\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `pid` | Process identifier |\n",
    "| `arrival_time` | Time when process enters the system |\n",
    "| `burst_time` | Total CPU time required |\n",
    "| `remaining_time` | Time left to complete execution |\n",
    "| `completion_time` | Time when process finishes |\n",
    "| `turnaround_time` | Total time from arrival to completion |\n",
    "| `waiting_time` | Time spent waiting in ready queue |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Queue Management**\n",
    "   - Sort processes by arrival time\n",
    "   - Use efficient deque for ready queue\n",
    "   - Track remaining time for each process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Selection**\n",
    "   - Select process from front of queue\n",
    "   - Execute for quantum or remaining time\n",
    "   - Move to back if not completed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Management**\n",
    "   - Track system clock\n",
    "   - Handle CPU idle periods\n",
    "   - Account for partial quantum execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tracks several key performance indicators:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time spent in ready queue\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time in system (completion - arrival)\n",
    "- **Response Time**: Time until first CPU burst\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of time CPU is busy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completed Processes**: List of Process objects with:\n",
    "   - Final completion times\n",
    "   - Turnaround calculations\n",
    "   - Waiting time statistics\n",
    "   - Response time data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schedule**: List of execution records containing:\n",
    "   - Process ID\n",
    "   - Start time\n",
    "   - Finish time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistics**: Dictionary containing:\n",
    "   - Average waiting time\n",
    "   - Average turnaround time\n",
    "   - Average response time\n",
    "   - CPU utilization"
