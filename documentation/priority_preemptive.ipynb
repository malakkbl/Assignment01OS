    "# Priority Preemptive CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Preemptive scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm where processes are assigned priorities, and the process with the highest priority (lowest numeric value) is selected for execution. The key feature is that a newly arrived process with higher priority can preempt (interrupt) the currently running process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles\n",
    "- Processes are selected based on priority (lower value = higher priority)\n",
    "- Preemptive: higher priority process can interrupt running process\n",
    "- Processes with equal priority are handled in FIFO order\n",
    "- Process resumes from where it was interrupted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Type**: Preemptive\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria**: Priority Value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Attributes\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `pid` | Process identifier |\n",
    "| `arrival_time` | Time when process enters the system |\n",
    "| `burst_time` | Total CPU time required |\n",
    "| `remaining_time` | Time left to complete execution |\n",
    "| `priority` | Priority value (lower = higher priority) |\n",
    "| `completion_time` | Time when process finishes |\n",
    "| `turnaround_time` | Total time from arrival to completion |\n",
    "| `waiting_time` | Time spent waiting in ready queue |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**\n",
    "   - Sort processes by arrival time\n",
    "   - Initialize ready queues for each priority level\n",
    "   - Set system clock to earliest arrival time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arrival Processing**\n",
    "   - Move newly arrived processes to priority queues\n",
    "   - Check for preemption if new process has higher priority\n",
    "   - Handle interrupted process state\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Selection**\n",
    "   - Choose highest priority ready process\n",
    "   - Track execution start time\n",
    "   - Update remaining time during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tracks several key performance indicators:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time spent in ready queue\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time in system (completion - arrival)\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of time CPU is busy\n",
    "- **Idle Time**: Time CPU spends waiting for processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completed Processes**: List of Process objects with:\n",
    "   - Final completion times\n",
    "   - Turnaround calculations\n",
    "   - Waiting time statistics\n",
    "   - Response time data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schedule**: List of execution records containing:\n",
    "   - Process ID\n",
    "   - Start time\n",
    "   - Finish time\n",
    "   - Preemption status\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistics**: Dictionary containing:\n",
    "   - Average waiting time\n",
    "   - Average turnaround time\n",
    "   - Average response time\n",
    "   - CPU utilization\n"
