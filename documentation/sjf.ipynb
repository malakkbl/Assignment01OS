    "# Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest Job First (SJF) is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest burst time from the ready queue. It aims to minimize average waiting time by prioritizing shorter processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles\n",
    "- Processes are selected based on burst time (shortest first)\n",
    "- Non-preemptive: once a process starts executing, it runs until completion\n",
    "- If multiple processes have same burst time, FCFS is used as tie-breaker\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Type**: Non-preemptive\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria**: Burst Time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Attributes\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `pid` | Process identifier |\n",
    "| `arrival_time` | Time when process enters the system |\n",
    "| `burst_time` | CPU time required by the process |\n",
    "| `completion_time` | Time when process finishes execution |\n",
    "| `turnaround_time` | Total time from arrival to completion |\n",
    "| `waiting_time` | Time spent waiting in ready queue |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**\n",
    "   - Sort processes by arrival time initially\n",
    "   - Initialize system clock to earliest arrival time\n",
    "   - Create empty ready queue\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scheduling Loop**\n",
    "   - At each time step:\n",
    "     - Add newly arrived processes to ready queue\n",
    "     - Select process with shortest burst time from ready queue\n",
    "     - Execute selected process to completion\n",
    "     - Update system clock and process metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Selection**\n",
    "   - Among ready processes, choose one with minimum burst time\n",
    "   - If burst times are equal, use arrival time as tie-breaker\n",
    "   - Update ready queue after process completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tracks several key performance indicators:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time spent in ready queue\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time in system (completion - arrival)\n",
    "- **Response Time**: Time until first CPU burst\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of time CPU is busy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "1. **Completed Processes**: List of Process objects with updated metrics\n",
    "2. **Schedule**: List of execution records containing:\n",
    "   - Process ID\n",
    "   - Start time\n",
    "   - Finish time\n",
    "3. **Statistics**: Dictionary containing:\n",
    "   - Average waiting time\n",
    "   - Average turnaround time\n",
    "   - Average response time\n",
    "   - CPU utilization"
