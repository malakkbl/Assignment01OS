    "# Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest Job First (SJF) is a non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles\n",
    "- Processes are selected based on shortest burst time\n",
    "- Non-preemptive: once a process starts executing, it runs to completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Type**: Non-preemptive\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria**: Burst Time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Attributes\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| `pid` | Process identifier |\n",
    "| `arrival_time` | Time when process enters the system |\n",
    "| `burst_time` | CPU time required by the process |\n",
    "| `completion_time` | Time when process finishes execution |\n",
    "| `turnaround_time` | Total time from arrival to completion |\n",
    "| `waiting_time` | Time spent waiting in ready queue |\n",
    "| `remaining_time` | Time left to complete execution |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Queue Management**\n",
    "   - Sort processes by arrival time initially\n",
    "   - Maintain ready queue of arrived processes\n",
    "   - Sort ready queue by burst time when selecting next process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scheduling Loop**\n",
    "   - Move newly arrived processes to ready queue\n",
    "   - Select process with shortest burst time from ready queue\n",
    "   - Execute selected process to completion\n",
    "   - Update process metrics and system clock\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tracks several key performance indicators:\n",
    "- **Waiting Time**: Time spent in ready queue\n",
    "- **Turnaround Time**: Total time in system (completion - arrival)\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of time CPU is busy\n",
    "- **Idle Time**: Time CPU spends waiting for processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "1. **Completed Processes**: List of Process objects with final statistics\n",
    "2. **Schedule**: List of execution records containing:\n",
    "   - Process ID\n",
    "   - Start time\n",
    "   - Finish time\n",
    "3. **Metrics**: Dictionary containing:\n",
    "   - Average waiting time\n",
    "   - Average turnaround time\n",
    "   - Average response time\n",
    "   - CPU utilization\n"
